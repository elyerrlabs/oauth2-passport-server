/**
 * The public.php routes file is intended for defining routes 
 * that need to exist **outside of the module's default URI prefix** 
 * or require a **custom URI prefix** different from the module name.
 * 
 * These routes can be **public** or **protected (authenticated)**, depending on your needs.
 * Use this file when you want more flexibility in route structure without being tied to the module path.
 * 
 * ⚠️ Caution: Overusing public.php or placing unrelated routes here 
 * can lead to route clutter, weak modular boundaries, and maintenance issues.
 * Always evaluate whether a route truly requires a custom/global path.
